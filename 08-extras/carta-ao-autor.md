# Letter to the Author

Dear Sebastian Raschka,

I would like to sincerely thank you for writing *Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*.

Your book provides something that is extremely rare in modern artificial intelligence education: a clear, structured, and accessible path to understanding one of the most complex topics in contemporary computing.

Your ability to transform dense theoretical concepts into practical, step-by-step learning experiences was deeply inspiring to me.

## A Personal Learning Journey Inspired by Your Work

After studying your book, I decided to create a personal educational project documenting my journey reproducing and studying the concepts you presented.

This project became a multi-chapter study series where I:

- reproduced the core implementations from the book  
- adapted the experiments to run entirely in Google Colab  
- expanded explanations in Brazilian Portuguese  
- created visual infographics to help explain abstract concepts  
- documented each step as an educational learning journal  

The main goal of this project was to make foundational LLM knowledge more accessible to Portuguese-speaking learners and to reinforce my own understanding through teaching and documentation.

## Clarification About Translation

I would like to explicitly clarify that this project is **not a technical translation of your book**.

I did not translate your text, chapters, or content directly.

Instead, I studied the concepts presented in your work and created an original educational adaptation inspired by the learning experience your book provided.

The material I produced is:

- independently written
- structured as a learning journal
- pedagogically adapted
- culturally localized for Brazilian Portuguese learners

This distinction is very important to me, both ethically and academically.

## An Important Clarification About Intent

I want to explicitly state that this project is **not intended as a correction, reinterpretation, or alternative version of your book**.

It is a learning journal and pedagogical adaptation inspired by your work, created with deep respect for the structure, clarity, and educational impact of your book.

Your material served as the foundation that made this entire study possible.

## A Sincere Apology (If Applicable)

Because this project was designed as an educational adaptation, some explanations were simplified or expanded with analogies to make concepts more accessible to beginners.

If at any point I unintentionally oversimplified, misinterpreted, or inaccurately represented any concept from your work, I sincerely apologize. That was never my intention.

Any simplification was made solely for pedagogical purposes, with the goal of helping new learners approach complex topics more comfortably.

## The Educational Impact of Your Book

Your book helped me move from simply using LLM tools to truly understanding how they are constructed and trained.

It changed my perspective from:

Using AI systems  
to  
Understanding AI systems  

That transformation is incredibly valuable for learners and professionals alike.

## Expanding Accessibility Through Language

One of my motivations was to help make foundational LLM education more accessible to Portuguese-speaking communities.

Technical adaptation is not only about language, but also about adapting context and learning style for different audiences. Your book made that adaptation possible by providing such a clear conceptual structure.

---

## Gratitude

Thank you for creating a resource that empowers learners to explore artificial intelligence beyond surface-level usage.

Your work contributes significantly to democratizing access to deep technical understanding in AI.

---

## Closing

It was an honor to learn from your work and to use it as inspiration for my own educational journey.

Thank you for making complex knowledge approachable and for contributing to the global learning community.

With respect and gratitude,

Angelo Mariano Grossi
